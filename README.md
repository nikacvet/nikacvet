### Hi there ðŸŒž

My name is Nika. 

I never know what to write in these, so I'll leave it at that. 

Here's some cool stats *(and yes, I chose to leave out the general stats card because I may or may not have forgotten to update my git from time to time and seeing the stats gave me the walk of shame moment.)*
